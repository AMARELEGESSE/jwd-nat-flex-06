# üèóÔ∏è Use If Else Statements to Solve the FizzBuzz Problem

Work with your team to implement the following user story:

* The FizzBuzz Problem
  * Create variable `myNumber`
  * Check that the value of the `myNumber` is of type `number`
  * If `myNumber` is not a number, print 'This is not a number' to the console.
  * If value of `myNumber` is a multiple of 3 print 'Fizz' to the console
  * If value of `myNumber` is a multiple of 5 print 'Buzz' to the console
  * If the value of `myNumber` is a multiple of both 3 and 5 (ex. 15) print FizzBuzz to the console
  * If the value of `myNumber` is any other number print the value of `myNumber` to the console.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when -- the message "**This is not a number**" is logged when the value of `myNumber` is not a number.

* It's done when -- the message "**FizzBuzz**" is logged when the value of `myNumber` is set to a multiple of 3 & 5.

* It's done when -- the message "**Fizz**" is logged when the value of `myNumber` is set to a multiple of 3.

* It's done when -- the message "**Buzz**" is logged when the value of `myNumber` is set to a multiple of 5.

## üí° Hints

* Reference Codecademy lessons: Introduction- Arithmetic Operators, Conditional Statements lessons 3, 4, 5,and 9

* Before you start writing your algorithm, do you have a plan documented in plain language that describes how you will use JavaScript to get it done?

* There is something you have to remember about the order of conditions you're checking when using `if`, `else if`, `else` statements.. what is it?
