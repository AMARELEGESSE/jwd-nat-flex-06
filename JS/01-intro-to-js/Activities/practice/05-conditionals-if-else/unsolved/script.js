// The FizzBuzz Problem
// Create variable myNumber
// Check that the value of the myNumber is of type number
// If myNumber is not a number, print 'This is not a number' to the console.
// If value of myNumber is a multiple of 3 print 'Fizz' to the console
// If value of myNumber is a multiple of 5 print 'Buzz' to the console
// If the value of myNumber is a multiple of both 3 and 5 (ex. 15) print FizzBuzz to the console
// If the value of myNumber is any other number print the value of myNumber to the console.

// Hint - Reference Codecademy lessons: Introduction- Arithmetic Opertaors, Conditional Statements lessons 3, 4, 5,and 9
// Hint - Before you start writing your algorithm, try pseudocoding a plan that describes how you write the code to solve this problem
// Hint - There is something you have to remember about the order of conditions you're checking when using `if`, `else if`, `else` statements.. what is it?
