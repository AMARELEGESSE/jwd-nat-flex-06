# üèóÔ∏è Use a Switch Statement to Automate a Store Price Check

* Start by linking your js file to your html file
* Open in browser/live server so you can see your changes in the console

* E-Commerce Item list
  * Use a swtich statement to print the price of the each item in the store to the console.
  * Ex. If the value of the variable is 'shoes' then, the statement `Shoes are $50` should be printed to the console.

    Items:
  * Shoes- $50
  * Jeans- $25
  * Hat- $12
  * Socks- $2
  * If the variable input is not an item in the store, then print 'Invalid Item' to the console.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when -- the message "**Invalid item**" is logged when the value of `storeItem` is set to an item that's not in the store.

* It's done when -- the message "**Shoes are $50**" is logged when the value of `storeItem` is set to the string value of of 'shoes'.

* It's done when -- the message "**Jeans are $25**" is logged when the value of `storeItem` is set to the string value of of 'jeans'.

* It's done when -- the message "**Socks are $2**" is logged when the value of `storeItem` is set to the string value of of 'socks'.
